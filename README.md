# Abstract
Experience is commonly thought to improve performance and decision making. However, evidence regarding this matter is not clear. In this paper We study the impact of previous experience on proficiency in decision making by analyzing how it affects decisions made by American football coaches regarding what plays to execute. Decisions are analyzed on two different outcomes: how they improve the expected points in a given possession, and how they improve the probability of winning a game. This can be seen as a short-term vs. long-term distinction. We find that, while experience has no impact on decision making with regard to probability of winning a game, it has a negative impact on decisions regarding expected points in a given possession. We also document the existence of heterogeneity in these results regarding type of game (regular season or playoffs), and type of optimal play to be chosen.
